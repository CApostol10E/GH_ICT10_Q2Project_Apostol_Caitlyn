<h1> School History: Sunrise Academy was founded in 1867 by two friends.who shared a dream of creating a learning environment that celebrated curiosity, creativity, and character. What began as a small academic center with only 82 students and 12 teachers has grown into a thriving institution known for innovation and excellence. During its early years, the school focused on core academic programs and basic facilities, operating in a single two-story building. By 1966, the school expanded its curriculum to include science laboratories, computer classes, and a developing arts program. This period marked the beginning of the schools legacy of blending traditional learning with modern educational approaches. In 2000, Sunrise Academy earned recognition as one of the regions most promising institutions due to its strong academic performance and progressive teaching methods. The school launched new student-centered programs including the Leadership Development Initiative, Eco-Guardians Club, and Campus Literacy Drive, emphasizing both academic growth and community involvement. A major milestone came in 2016 when the school opened the Innovation and Learning Center, equipped with advanced laboratories, a multimedia hub, and collaborative learning spaces. This development strengthened the schools position as a forward-thinking institution committed to preparing students for a rapidly evolving world. Today, Sunrise Academy stands proudly with over 1 million students. It's equipped with  modern facilities, a diverse range of clubs and organizations, and a dedicated faculty team. Despite its growth, the school continues to uphold its founding values — excellence, integrity, creativity, and service — shaping young learners into compassionate and capable leaders of the future.</h1>
